A Socially Augmented Hybrid Recommendation Engine

This is a new take on the existing recommender systems. It employs not only a users ratings but also that of his/her social circle to generate
recommendations.

This project was persued by me as an academic project as mini project for the partial fulfilment of my Bachelors of Technology
course at IIIT-Allahabad.
